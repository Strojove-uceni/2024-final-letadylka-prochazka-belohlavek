        "# Introduction\n",
        "Welcome to the demo file, where one can run the project with zero effort and see the results and visualistaion for themselves. While this is an easy and plesant way to enjoy this Neural Net, we strongly urge anyone who visits this demo to run the project as it was intended, expand upon it and improve it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Abstract\n",
        "This project was created and submited as the final semestral project for the Machine Learning 2 class on FNSPE CTU. This project concerns itself with reinforcement learning for multiple agents controlled by a single neural net in a graph environment. The core aim of this project is to provide a neural network solution that efficiently navigates multiple planes along a fully connected graph with the goal of estimating the shortest path, while avoiding collisions of planes. We implemented an enhanced version of a classical replay buffer that samples experiences based on the predicted future reward to assist the learning process. We also added regularization techniques, since the dimensionality of our problem is much larger compared to the on in the repository we cite.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Run the Project\n",
        "For those who decide to download the project and run the training on their PC, please beware of the configurations. A basic setup is present in /data as demo_config.yaml\n",
        "\n",
        "Setting up capacity, minibatch_size or sequence_length too high may result in freezing the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most hyperparameters may be changed in the config.yaml file. If you intend to do your own sweeps on weights and biases, we have also uploaded a version of the main file wandb_main.py that supports sweep configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you however decide to only run the project in this demo file, note that any pre-trained models are too large to upload to the GitHub repo directly, so the training will be done from scratch here. The training will use the demo_confing with small number of steps and generally \"low\" settings, so taht the training can be completed in reasonable amount of time. Therefore, one should expect very poor results compared to the results we present at the end of this notebook. Note that we need to install specific versions of many libraries that are compatible, this may take a while.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Runtime may encounter an error with tensorflow, simply restart Runtime and run the following cells and training will start. The training takes about 5 minutes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**To see the training and results, simply run the following code boxes.**\n"

        "## Reinforcement Learning\n",
        "First, let's introduce the concept of reinforcement learning with multiple agents. Each agent observes only a partial view of some environment and state information. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning approach, where agents learn to make sequential decisions by interacting with an environment. Each agent hold a local and/or global observation of its environment. Through a process of trial and error, the agent receives rewards or penalties for their actions, enabling it to discover an optimal policy for achieving specific goals. In our case, for example, we used Epsilon-Greedy policy, where at the beginning the agent makes random decisions to explore the environment and allow itself to learn the interactions. Then it gradually transfers to learned behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of multiple agents, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) play a critical role in handling temporal dependencies. For example, in multi-agent RL, RNNs can be used to model and predict the behavior of agents based on sequences of past experiences, enabling better coordination and communication between agents. By maintaining hidden states that encapsulate the history of interactions, RNNs empowers agents to adapt to dynamic environments and collaborate effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our work prouds itself amongst other things on the replay_buffer that significantly improved the prediction of paths that lead to future reward. A replay buffer is a key component in reinforcement learning that stores past experiences, typically in the form of state, action, reward, and next state tuples. For RNNs, which rely on sequential dependencies, replay buffers are particularly important as they allow the agent to learn from diverse trajectories while maintaining temporal coherence. By sampling batches of sequences instead of independent transitions, the replay buffer ensures that the RNN captures meaningful patterns over time, improving its ability to model long-term dependencies. Additionally, we implemented a version of replay buffer that samples the batch sequences based on maximizing the td_error, hence the mean square error between predicted future and immediate rewards. This allows the agents to learn and prioritize paths that lead to targets as that is the place of the most future reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Q-values Prediction\n",
        "We use Q-Net for q_value predictions, a reinforcement learning technique that assigns values to each future action for one step into the future based on agent's observations (state). In this particular setting, the Q-Net predicts the reward for each edge the agent could take at any given step. We implemented a node mask and generalized the setting to fit grahps with variable edge count for each node. The algorithm in Q-Net implements dynamic programming weighted by the learning rate hyperparameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$Q_{target} = (1-l)*Q_{now}+l * E[R_{t+1}(a_{t+1}, s_{t+1}) + \\gamma * max_{a_{t+1}}Q_{next}(a_{t+1}, s_{t+1})| s_t],$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $R_{t+1}(a_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ is sampled from batch of experiences and $l$ signifies learning rate. From this formulation, we can se that sampling the batch indices that maximize the td_error, we essentially grow the $Q_{now}$ values for future steps.\n",

        "## Classical MLP\n",
        "MLP is a feed forward network that passes the input thourgh many linear layers with activation functions. In our case, we used leaky-ReLU as the activation function. It is also possible to modify this setting to for example GeLU in the config.yaml file but we should points out that this may lead to the agent learning to take forbidden edges, that are subsequently masked leading to insufficient gradient flow. This approach has not been explored in this project. Dropout is included for regularization."

        "It is apparent that selecting lower number of com_rounds as well as increasing the mini_batch_size improves the model greatly. Although the epsilon_update_frequency does not show as important, it could be due to the narrow range we selected for the sweep. We advice to set this parameter to about 70 for 75k steps and gradually increase this number with increasing number of steps. A good rule of thumb is that after the training the epsilon value should be around 0.01, where there is a hard line so that if epsilon dips below 0.01 it is reset to 0.01.\n",
        "## DQN, DGN settings\n",
        "Gamma seemed to be the most important hyperparameter in this setting, which is not all that surprising because of the architecture that goes almost directly into the Q_Net. We saw consistent improvement in the gathered reward with the gamma parameter being set lower (to around 0.92-0,95) for 75k steps. Epsilon update frequency shows here as a very important hyperparameter with a strong negative correlation. This means that epsilon should be updated more often, which suggests that the models are able to learn to navigate the environment quickly. The number of attention heads and attention layers shows a positive correlation with the reward.\n",

        "On the other hand, in the case of DQN and DGN, SUM seemed to perform better. From our own experience from training the models for more steps, we would reccomend using SUM as it is faster and the results are comparable."

What's more interesting is that we observed a clean positive correlation between reward and throughput, meaning that with higher mean reward achieved the number of planes that landed was also higher. This effectively means that the agents did not find a loophole in the reward system, which is very pleasant and we are very intrigued by this result. These claims deserve more backing and rigorous testing as well as the before mentioned sweeps of the hyperparameter space.
